# Metro Network Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the metro network of a city, specifically using Delhi as a case study. By applying graph theory and network analysis techniques, the goal is to identify bottlenecks, optimize routes, and enhance urban transportation planning to improve commuter efficiency and overall city infrastructure.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Graph Theory Application**: Modeled the metro network as a graph to analyze connectivity and flow.
- **Network Analysis**: Identified critical stations and routes that are pivotal for network efficiency.
- **Optimization Strategies**: Proposed methods to reduce congestion and improve route planning.
- **Data Visualization**: Included dynamic plots and maps to visually represent the network and analysis results.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Network Analysis: `networkx`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The analysis utilizes a dataset (`metro.csv`) containing information about the metro stations and their connections. This dataset is essential for constructing the network graph and performing subsequent analyses.
